# Calculator

My second attempt at a C# form project.
I'm following the tutorial I found <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Creating-a-Calculator-Visual-Studio-C/" target="_blank">` here. `</a>
This one was fun, but I noticed the functionality of the calculator is a bit bare-bones, so I'm thinking of coming back to this one eventually and add some features, like displaying the operator symbols in the text box as the user is typing what they want to do.
